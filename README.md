This package allows to extract weight and timing data from Bluetooth-based remote scales, providing automatic detection, tracking and analysis of coffee / espresso brew processes. Data tracking can be configured to the setup at hand and results can be emitted to e.g. an InfluxDB for long-term tracking.

**NOTE: This package is currently work in progress. Interfaces and implementation are subject to change.**
